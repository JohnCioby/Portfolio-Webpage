    <h2>I started coding when I was 12 years old using a friend's computer, making my first little program in C++.
      I stopped doing it due to the lack of resources , mainly the necessary money to buy a computer of my own.
      I've managed to buy a computer about 12 years later and that's when I tried to make a game.
      I used Unreal Engine 4 and I was coding in C++ and I loved every second of that project , until I realized
      that my computer is not powerful enough to make it. I have to say that was quite a big disappointment. Now
      when I am 31 years old I said to myself that I have to try again and not give up until I make it and I enrolled
      to Codecademy's course and I have to say it has been great. I fell in love with coding a long time ago but just
      recently I decided that this is what I would like to do when it comes to my career. Now my goal is to study hard
      and with the help from Codecademy and the internet which has been of great help, I am determined to succeed and 
      become a software developer. You know what they say "Do what you love and you won't work a day in your life".<br>
      I truly believe that!</h2>
